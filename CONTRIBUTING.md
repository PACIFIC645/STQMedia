## Development Environment

This project was developed using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). While you can contribute from any system (Linux, macOS, or Windows), **using WSL on Windows is recommended for a smoother setup and compatibility with our tooling and scripts**.

To get started with WSL, see the [official install guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

If you encounter environment-specific problems, feel free to ask questions in Issues or Discussions!
